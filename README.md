# Politeness-EN-vs-CH
Creating classifiers to resolve misunderstandings between native English speakers (predominantly American) and Chinese ESL speakers.

## So far:

In examining features of person (1st vs 2nd vs 3rd), there are no distinctions in frequency for any labels for native speakers and ESL speakers.

In regards to passive voice, it appears native speakers are much more likely to see passive voice as polite compared to Chinese ESL speakers.

## TODO:

Parse CSV file inside Jupyter Notebook, create my own classifiers for English and Chinese ESL. Explore additional features that were used in the paper pdf included for quick ref.
